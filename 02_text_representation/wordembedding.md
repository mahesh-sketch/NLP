# 🌍 Word Embedding Techniques Explained (With Real-Life Examples)

## 🧠 Why Word Embeddings?

Earlier methods like BoW, BoN, and TF-IDF treat words **independently**. They cannot understand context or semantics.

> **Real-Life Analogy**: Imagine a map. Locations close to each other are usually related — just like words that occur together in sentences. Word embeddings position words on a "semantic map", capturing meaning and relationships.

## ❌ Limitations of Traditional Techniques

| Technique | Limitations |
|----------|-------------|
| BoW (Bag of Words) | Ignores word order and context |
| BoN (Bag of N-Grams) | High dimensionality, limited context |
| TF-IDF | Sparse, no semantic understanding |

> Example:  
> "I love playing football" vs. "I enjoy playing soccer"  
> → Totally different in TF-IDF but semantically similar!

# 🔶 1. Static Word Embeddings (Neural Predictive Models)

These produce **fixed vectors per word**, regardless of context.

---

### ✅ Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip-Gram)

- **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)**: Predicts a word from surrounding context  
  `Context ➝ Target Word`

- **Skip-Gram**: Predicts context words from a target word  
  `Target Word ➝ Context Words`

> Example:  
> Sentence: *"I love playing football"*  
> CBOW: Input: [I, love, football] ➝ Predict: playing  
> Skip-Gram: Input: playing ➝ Predict: [I, love, football]

---

### ✅ GloVe (Global Vectors)

- Uses word **co-occurrence statistics**
- Positions words based on how often they appear together

> Example: "Ice" appears often with "cold", rarely with "hot". GloVe captures this.

---

### ✅ FastText

- Breaks words into **subwords (n-grams)**
- Handles **misspellings**, **rare** or **out-of-vocabulary** words

> Example: *"Playing"* ➝ "play", "lay", "aying", etc.

### 🔧 Use Cases

| Technique | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| Word2Vec | Fast training on custom corpus |
| GloVe | General semantic understanding |
| FastText | Morphological richness, typos, rare words |

# 🤖 2. Contextual Embeddings (Transformers)

Contextual embeddings generate **different vectors** for the **same word** based on the **sentence context**.

---

### ✅ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

- Considers **left and right** context
- Trained via **masked language modeling**

> Example:  
> "The [MASK] was barking" ➝ BERT predicts: *dog*

---

### ✅ GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

- Reads **left-to-right** only (unidirectional)
- Great for **text generation** and completion

> Example:  
> "I feel really [MASK] today" ➝ GPT ➝ happy, energetic, great

---

### 🔧 Use Cases

| Model | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| BERT | Understanding tasks: QA, classification, NER |
| GPT | Generation: story writing, text prediction, chatbots |

---

# 🧬 3. Deep Sequential Embeddings (LSTM)

### ✅ ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)

- Based on **Bi-directional LSTM**
- Embeddings change based on **sentence-level context**

> Example:  
> - "He kicked the **bucket**" → idiom  
> - "He filled the **bucket**" → literal  
> → ELMo captures the difference

---

### 🔧 Use Case

- Sentiment analysis
- Named entity recognition
- Syntax-sensitive tasks

# 🚀 Final Notes

- Static embeddings are fast and effective for traditional NLP tasks.
- For deeper understanding and production-quality NLP, **transformers** are the new standard.
- Always evaluate based on your **dataset size**, **task complexity**, and **available compute**.
