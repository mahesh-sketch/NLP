# üß† Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## üìå What is NLP?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables machines to read, understand, interpret, and generate human language.

NLP combines **computational linguistics**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning** to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## üöÄ Real-World Applications of NLP

| Domain             | Application Example                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Customer Service   | Auto-resolving support tickets (chatbots)     |
| Healthcare         | Analyzing patient reports                      |
| Finance            | Fraud detection from transaction messages     |
| E-commerce         | Product review sentiment analysis              |
| Legal              | Contract summarization and clause extraction  |
| HR/Recruitment     | Resume parsing and candidate ranking           |
| Education          | Grammar checkers, essay scoring                |

## üîÑ NLP Pipeline

Let‚Äôs understand the **NLP pipeline** using an example: handling customer support tickets raised on an IT platform.

---

### üì• 1. Text Acquisition

**Goal:** Collect raw textual data from various sources.

- Example: Tickets submitted by users/developers on platforms like Jira, Freshdesk.
- Tickets might be collected via APIs, databases, CSV exports, or cloud buckets.

> üìå *Sample Ticket:*
> "The application crashs when I clikc the 'Submit' buton on mobile!"

---

### üßπ 2. Text Extraction and Clean-Up

**Goal:** Clean the text and correct any informalities.

- Correct spelling errors: `crashs` ‚Üí `crashes`, `clikc` ‚Üí `click`
- Remove irrelevant symbols or HTML tags
- Convert to lowercase
- Remove stopwords (e.g., *the, on, and*)

### üßΩ 3. Text Preprocessing

| Task               | Description                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sentence Segmentation | Break a paragraph into individual sentences            |
| Tokenization       | Break sentences into individual words (tokens)             |
| Stemming           | Reduce words to their root (e.g., *running* ‚Üí *run*)       |
| Lemmatization      | Normalize words based on grammar (e.g., *better* ‚Üí *good*) |

> üìå *Example Preprocessed Output:*
> `['application', 'crash', 'click', 'submit', 'button']`

### üß∞ 4. Feature Engineering

**Goal:** Convert text into numerical values for model input.

| Technique         | Description                                     | Use Case                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Bag of Words      | Count word occurrences                          | Text classification     |
| TF-IDF            | Weigh words by frequency and uniqueness         | Document categorization |
| Word2Vec          | Convert words into dense vectors (semantic)     | Deep learning models    |
| One-Hot Encoding  | Encode each word as a binary vector             | Small vocabulary        |
| Label Encoding    | Assign unique integer to each word/category     | Ordinal data encoding   |

---

### ü§ñ 5. Model Training

Train an ML or DL model on the engineered features.

| Task                    | Suitable Models                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Ticket Categorization    | Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression          |
| Sentiment Detection      | LSTM, GRU, BERT                           |
| Duplicate Ticket Detection| Siamese Networks, BERT                   |
| Ticket Routing           | Random Forest, SVM, Transformers         |

---

### üöÄ 6. Model Deployment

Deploy the trained model to serve predictions in real time.

- Methods: Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes
- Platforms: AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML
- The model returns predictions like **ticket category** or **assigned developer**

---

### üîÅ End-to-End Flow:

```plaintext
1. Tickets raised by users
2. Text cleaned and preprocessed
3. Text converted to vectors (TF-IDF / Word2Vec)
4. Trained model predicts category (Bug, Feature, etc.)
5. Auto-assigns or suggests resolution path
